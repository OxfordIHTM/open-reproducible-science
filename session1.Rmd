# What is Open Science?

.pull-left[

.footnote[based on UNESCO concept 2021]

.pull-right[
* movement to make scientific research and dissemination accessible to anyone

* aims for greater transparency in research and remove barriers for sharing outputs, resources, methods or tools at any stage of the research process

# What is Reproducible Research?

.pull-left[
.center[![](images/scientific_method.png)]

.footnote[from the [Open Science Training Handbook](https://open-science-training-handbook.github.io/Open-Science-Training-Handbook_EN//02OpenScienceBasics/04ReproducibleResearchAndDataAnalysis.html)]
]

.pull-right[
* The concept of reproducibility is directly linked to the scientific method
  1. Formulating a hypothesis

  2. Designing the study

  3. Running the study and collecting the data

  4. Analyzing the data

  5. Reporting the study

* Each of these steps should be clearly reported by providing clear and open documentation, and thus making the study transparent and reproducible.

# What is Reproducible Research?

.pull-left[
* Research papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to directly reproduce the results and
employ the methods that are presented in the research paper ([Gentleman and Lang, 2004](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.684.9629&rep=rep1&type=pdf))

* Research data and code are made available so that others are able to reach the same results as are claimed in scientific outputs ([Open Science Training Handbook](https://open-science-training-handbook.github.io/Open-Science-Training-Handbook_EN//02OpenScienceBasics/04ReproducibleResearchAndDataAnalysis.html))

* The standard of reproducibility calls for the data and the computer code used to analyze the data be made available to others ([Peng, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3383002/pdf/nihms382015.pdf))

# Factors in irreproducible research

---

# Factors in irreproducible research

* Not enough documentation on how experiment is conducted and data is generated

* Data used to generate original results unavailable

* Software used to generate original results unavailable

* Difficult to recreate software environment (libraries, versions) used to generate original results

* Difficult to rerun the computational steps

# How to do Reproducible Research?

.pull-left[
### The reproducibility spectrum

]

.pull-right[
### Steps in reproducible research

* Record the project’s provenance

* Data and metadata curation

* Establish a testing/analysis workflow

* Test, document, and publish your code

* Share

# Why R for Reproducible Research?

.pull-left[
* freely available

* huge user and developer community

* has a robust set of user- and community-developed packages that support reproducible research
