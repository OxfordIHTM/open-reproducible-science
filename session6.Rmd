# Automation

.center[![](images/automation.png)]

### 'Automating' comes from the roots 'auto-' meaning 'self-', and 'mating', meaning 'screwing'

???

---

# What can be automated?

* works best with a **project workflow** (sometimes called a **project pipeline**)

    - our recommended solution for this is the `{targets}` workflow/pipeline

* works best if project workflow is **portable**

    - our recommended solution for this is `{renv}`

---

# Why automate?

* to reproduce previous results

* to recreate results deleted by *fat fingers*

* to rerun the workflow/pipeline with updated software

* to run the same workflow/pipeline on a new dataset

* `GitHub Actions` allows **automation**, **customisation**, and **execution** of your research project workflows right in your GitHub repository.

* Composed of a job or a number of jobs. The job/s are then composed of steps that control the order in which actions are run in order to complete a job/s. This workflow is scheduled or triggered by a specific event and runs on what is called a runner - a server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed - that is either hosted by GitHub, or self-hosted on your own machines.

* This whole workflow including the event trigger and the runner on which the workflow will run in are specified and detailed using a workflow `.yml` file that is saved inside a directory named `.github` within your GitHub repository in which you want to use GitHub Actions on.
