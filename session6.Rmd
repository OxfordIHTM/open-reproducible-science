# Automation

.center[![](images/automation.png)]

### 'Automating' comes from the roots 'auto-' meaning 'self-', and 'mating', meaning 'screwing'

???

---

# What can be automated?

* works best with a **project workflow** (sometimes called a **project pipeline**)

    - our recommended solution for this is the `{targets}` workflow/pipeline

* works best if project workflow is **portable**

    - our recommended solution for this is `{renv}`

---

# Why automate?

* to reproduce previous results

* to recreate results deleted by *fat fingers*

* to rerun the workflow/pipeline with updated software

* to run the same workflow/pipeline on a new dataset

* `GitHub Actions` allows **automation**, **customisation**, and **execution** of your research project workflows right in your GitHub repository.

* Composed of a job or a number of jobs. The job/s are then composed of steps that control the order in which actions are run in order to complete a job/s. This workflow is scheduled or triggered by a specific event and runs on what is called a runner - a server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed - that is either hosted by GitHub, or self-hosted on your own machines.

* This whole workflow including the event trigger and the runner on which the workflow will run in are specified and detailed using a workflow `.yml` file that is saved inside a directory named `.github` within your GitHub repository in which you want to use GitHub Actions on.

# Setting the `trigger` for the automation

```YAML
name: check assignment

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]
  workflow_dispatch:
    branches:
      - '*'
```

---

# Defining `jobs` to be implemented in the workflow

```YAML
jobs:
  check-assignment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: rocker/geospatial:4.1.2
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
```
      
---

# Specifying `steps` in the workflow

### Workflow step 1: reproduce the system environment

```YAML
      - name: Install system dependencies
        run: |
          apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
          git-crypt libxt6 libglpk-dev
```

### Workflow step 2: Reproduce the R project-local environment

```YAML
      - name: Install packages from renv.lock (with cache)
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@master
        with:
          cache-version: 2
```

---
   
# Specifying `steps` in the workflow

### Workflow step 3: Perform tests/checks

```YAML
      - name: Check that targets workflow has been enabled
        run: |
          testthat::test_that("Target script file exists",
            testthat::expect_true(
              list.files(pattern = "_targets.R") == "_targets.R"
            )
          )
        shell: Rscript {0}
      
      - name: Check that renv has been enabled/initialised
        run: |
          testthat::test_that("renv has been enabled", {
            testthat::expect_true(
              list.files(pattern = "renv.lock") == "renv.lock",
            )
            testthat::expect_true(
              list.files(pattern = ".Rprofile", all.files = TRUE) == ".Rprofile"
            )
            testthat::expect_true(
              any(list.dirs(recursive = FALSE) == "./renv")
            )          
          })
        shell: Rscript {0}
```

---

# Specifying `steps` in the workflow

### Workflow step 4: Run the targets workflow

```YAML        
      - name: Check that targets workflow runs without errors
        run: |
          targets::tar_make()
        shell: Rscript {0}
```
