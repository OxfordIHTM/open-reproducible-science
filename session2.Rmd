# What is git?

.pull-left[
* Free and open source distributed **version control system**

* Built for software development for a group of developers to work collaboratively and to manage the evolution of a set of files

    - like *"Track Changes"* in Microsoft Word on steriods!

* Has been re-purposed to manage a collection of files that make up a typical data analytical project that consists of data, figures, reports, and source code

# Why use Git?

.pull-left[
.center[![](images/phdcomics-filenames.gif)]
]

.pull-right[
### Version control

* Is the only reasonable and sane way to keep track changes in source code, manuscripts, presentations, and data analysis projects

* Documentation of differences between versions

* Exploration of differences between versions

.pull-right[
### Communication and collaboration

* **Communicating** one's research project with other people is part of the scientific process - not just results but the whole process

* **Collaborating** with others on each other's research project allows us to build on each other's past work, using them for a different context/problem, or re-purposing them to come up with a new approach/solution

* Communication and collaboration on various aspects of the scientific process is faciliated by using Git

# What is GitHub?

.pull-right[

<!---
.center[![](images/GitHub_Logo.png)]
--->

* Service provider of hosting for software development and version control using Git

* Offers distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features such as bug tracking, feature request, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project

* Like *facebook* but for programmers

* Facilitates *"openness"* of **Open Source**

* Lowers the barriers to collaboration

# Git integration with RStudio

.pull-left[
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for [R](https://cran.r-project.org)

* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) has built-in facilities for [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com)

* Within [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), one can create an [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) project (a directory with some special files to describe specific [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) options) which becomes your git repository

* One can easily turn a current git repository into an [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) project.
