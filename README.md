# Open Science and Reproducible Research in R: *An Oxford International Health and Tropical Medicine Lecture Series*

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Open Science is the practice of science in such a way that others can
collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other
research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse,
redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data
and methods. Reproducible research means that research data and code are
made available so that others are able to reach the same results as are
claimed in scientific outputs. Closely related is the concept of
replicability, the act of repeating a scientific methodology to reach
similar conclusions. These concepts are core elements of empirical
research.

This 6-part lecture series is designed to give Oxford IHTM students a
foundational understanding and appreciation of the pillars of Open
Science more broadly and within that the concepts, methods and tools for
Reproducible Research more specifically. To further the students’
learning, practical examples and exercises will be discussed and walked
through using the R language for statistical computing as a way to
practically demonstrate these concepts.

## Session 1: Open Science and Reproducible Research in R: An Overview

In this session, an overview of the what, why, and how of Open Science
and Reproducible Research will be discussed to provide the learners with
foundational understanding and appreciation of these concepts and their
applications.

## Session 2: Git and GitHub for use with R: tools for versioning and sharing research

In this session, an overview of git and GitHub will be discussed along
with their integration with R using RStudio. This wil then be followed
by a practical session to guide learners on setting up git and GitHub
onto their personal machines culminating in the learners accessing their
first assignment in GitHub Classroom.

## Session 3: Data extraction, transformation, and loading in R

In this session, a discussion on the current state of *“data”* in
general and how this translates to *global health data* specifically.
This discussion will then be linked to how the use of R can facilitate
and support researchers in dealing with *data* in an open and
reproducible way. The final part of the session will be focused on a
data exercise using R based on Exercise 1 found in the [**Practical R
for Epidemiologists**](https://practical-r.org/exercise2.html) book.

## Session 4: Reproducible scientific workflows in R

In this session, a discussion of best practices on reproducible
scientific workflows and an introduction to using the `{targets}` to
implemenet these workflows. The final part of the session will continue
on the data exercise using R based on Exercise 1 found in the
[**Practical R for
Epidemiologists**](https://practical-r.org/exercise2.html) book.

## Session 5: Making your R-based research project portable

In this session, a discussion of R code portability, the factors that
impact how the R code/script we develop can be used and run successfully
by someone else, and the currently available solutions to ensuring
portability. The final part of the session will continue on the data
exercise using R based on Exercise 1 found in the [**Practical R for
Epidemiologists**](https://practical-r.org/exercise2.html) book.

In this session, a discussion of automation, its application on R
project workflows, and current available tools for use in automation of
workflows. The final part of the session will continue on the data
