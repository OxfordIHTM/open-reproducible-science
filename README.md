# Oxford International Health and Tropic Medicine Lecture Series on Open Science and Reproducible Research in R

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Open Science is the practice of science in such a way that others can
collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other
research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse,
redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data
and methods. Reproducible research means that research data and code are
made available so that others are able to reach the same results as are
claimed in scientific outputs. Closely related is the concept of
replicability, the act of repeating a scientific methodology to reach
similar conclusions. These concepts are core elements of empirical
research.

This 6-part lecture series is designed to give Oxford IHTM students a
foundational understanding and appreciation of the pillars of Open
Science more broadly and within that the concepts, methods and tools for
Reproducible Research more specifically. To further the students’
learning, practical examples and exercises will be discussed and walked
through using the R language for statistical computing as a way to
practically demonstrate these concepts.

## Session 1: Open Science and Reproducible Research in R: An Overview

In this session, an overview of the what, why, and how of Open Science
and Reproducible Research will be discussed to provide the learners with
foundational understanding and appreciation of these concepts and their
applications.

guide to conducting reproducible research in ecology, evolution, and
conservation. 10.32942/osf.io/h5r6n.
