# Project-orientd workflows in R

---

# Why organise workflows into projects

* key word is *"organise"*;

* organisation ensures *coherence* and *order* which is helpful to the user whenever he/she goes back to the same work again later;

* organisation supports good documentation; and,

* organisation allows for collaboration.

---

# How to organise workflows into projects

* a unique piece of *"work"* should be its own *project*;

* all resources and tools needed for a *project* should be within the same directory; and,

* group resources and tools within appropriately into their own directories with the project directory.

# Literate programming

---

# Why use literate programming

* write code that satisfies both the machine/computer and the human reader/user;

* highlight and give as much importance to the documentation of the processes and the outputs that your code represents;

* focus on communication and understanding of the process and the output; and,

* single document that integrates both code and textual documentation.

---

# R Markdown for literate programming


* R Markdown provides an authoring framework for literate programming;

* A single R Markdown file is used to both save and execute code, and generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience; and,

* R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of static and dynamic output formats.

# Basics of R Markdown

* An R Markdown document is written in markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format) and contains chunks of embedded R code, like the document below.
